# Machine-Learning-Unity  

## Overview  
**Machine-Learning-Unity** is a Unity project designed to integrate machine learning models directly into the game engine using Unity Barracuda. The project leverages custom-trained models for real-time AI interactions, enabling enhanced gameplay mechanics and seamless cross-platform performance. This innovative approach allows developers to incorporate intelligent behavior into their games without external dependencies.
